# Description
Our project is a demo for an infusion pump that is controlled by the vital signs of the patient (in this case, heart rate)
# Components used 
1. Stepper motor (from recycled cd rom [learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJxB2O2FsAo))
2. Arduino Uno board
3. Heart Rate sensor ([get it here](https://ram-e-shop.com/product/kit-pulse-rate/))
4. H bridge (L298N module) ([get it here](https://ram-e-shop.com/product/kit-l298-red/)) 
5. Arduino Bluetooth module ([get it here](https://ram-e-shop.com/product/kit-bluetooth-hc05/))
6. Medical syringe

# How to use
The sensor is placed on the patient's hand to measure the heart rate. 

When the heart rate is outside the normal range the infusion pump changes the speed of infusion of the drug.
# Limitations
- Heart rate sensor is not accurate enough / not in contact at all times
- Stepper motor might not be strong enough for viscous infusion solutions
